## Workshop Description 

While many people associate Git with computer programming and software development, it can also be used to produce "change histories" for long-form writing projects such as dissertations. These change histories are useful because they allow you to not only track edits over time but also "version" your work by identifying moments of significant difference between this draft and that one. Additionally, Git encourages you to treat your writing projects as repositories, including files for text editing, word processing, images, video, audio, code, and primary and secondary sources. In so doing, it becomes a simple way to archive your work, pushing it to and pulling it from a remote server. 

Without assuming any familiarity with Git or GitHub, this workshop walks participants through the basics of using Git to write in Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux. I will show participants how Git works, how to use it to create change histories, and how to sync it with GitHub for backup and distribution. I will also point to scholarly communication projects that currently use Git and GitHub, including projects published by the MLA. In so doing, I will address participant questions and concerns about using Git to version a dissertation, highlighting how Git is both a conceptual and technical matter of praxis. 

During the workshop, participants may either follow along using their own computers or take notes for later reference. Either way, the workshop is ultimately intended to be a conversation about how and why dissertations may be "versioned" and to what effects on the styles, modes, forms, and shelf lives of scholarly communication. 

If participants would like to follow along using their own computers, then, prior to the workshop, they are encouraged to: 1) install Git on their machines (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and 2) create a GitHub account (https://github.com/). However, neither of these is necessary for participation. Should participants have any queries prior to the workshop, they are welcome to email me at jentery@uvic.ca.
