# DH and/in the Dissertation (Opening Remarks for DHSI at MLA 2016)

If we approach them rhetorically, digital dissertations are frequently immersed in grand narratives of massive change. And the word, "digital," may not do us any favors. After all, it is easily intertwined with the logic of positivism, whereby changes in digital technologies are equated with social or cultural progress. In fact, what might matter most for digital dissertations is quite everyday. For instance, consider the following questions: 

* How is a digital dissertation filed or archived? For a compelling response, see [Amanda Visconti's dissertation](https://github.com/amandavisconti/infinite-ulysses-dissertation).
* How is a digital dissertation circulated? For instance, how do dissertation committees received it, and in what formats? While formats may seem quite boring, see Jonathan Sterne's notion of [format studies](https://www.dukeupress.edu/mp3). 
* How is a digital dissertation read and commented on? In this instance, I'm not even thinking about matters of assessment. I'm referring to the basics of how and where people comment on dissertations, including drafts.

With such questions in mind, I wonder if we might consider today's workshops a collection of small steps, which gather steam and significance over time. 

After all, it may not be the grand ideas of the dissertation, but rather its everydayness, that's most difficult to change.
