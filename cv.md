# Computer Vision as a Public Act: On Digital Humanities and Algocracy 

Computer vision is generally associated with the programmatic description and reconstruction of the physical world in digital form (Szeliski 2010: 3-10). It helps people construct and express visual patterns in data, such as patterns in image, video, and text repositories. The processes involved in this recognition are incredibly tedious, hence tendencies to automate them with algorithms. They are also increasingly common in everyday life, expanding the role of algorithms in the reproduction of culture. From the perspective of economic sociology, A. Aneesh links such expansion to "a new kind of power" and governance, which he refers to as "*algocracy*—rule of the algorithm, or rule of the code" (Aneesh 2006: 5). Here, the programmatic treatment of the physical world in digital form is so significantly embedded in infrastructures that algorithms tacitly shape behaviors and prosaically assert authority in tandem with existing bureaucracies. Routine decisions are delegated (knowingly or not) to computational procedures that—echoing the work of Alexander Galloway (2001), Wendy Chun (2011), and many others in media studies—run in the background as protocols or default settings. For the purposes of this MLA panel, I am specifically interested in how humanities researchers may not only interpret computer vision as a public act but also intervene in it through a sort of “critical technical practice” (Agre 1997: 155) advocated by digital humanities scholars such as Tara McPherson (2012) and Alan Liu (2012). In the case of computer vision, such critical technical practice may begin by relinquishing any assumptions that computer vision can be fully understood as, or simply reduced to, "source code." Then, without eagerly adopting new technologies, it might proceed to ask whether (if ever) and how computer vision should be used for humanities research. In short, *digital humanities must more rigorously engage the question of treating bodies as big data*, especially as the oppressive and algocratic effects of computer vision become all the more palpable in everyday life.  

According to various accounts, computer vision research began as early as 1966, during the “Summer Vision Project,” when Marvin Minsky, Seymour Papert, Gerald Jay Sussman, and others in the Artificial Intelligence Group (AIG) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) investigated how to use figure-ground analysis to automatically divide pictures into regions based on surface and shape properties. This region description would act as the basis for object identification, where items in pictures were recognized and named by machines with controlled vocabularies of known objects (Pappert 1966; Crevier 1993; Boden 2006). Cameras were attached to computers in order to achieve this automated description and identification, with an express desire to eventually construct a pattern analysis system that would combine "maximal flexibility" with "heuristic rules" (Papert 1966: 6).
